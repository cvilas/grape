## What is Grape?

GRAPE is a framework to develop distributed and embedded control applications, with hooks for instrumentation and remote monitoring.

It's also a hobby project; an experimental playground to learn/evaluate/apply modern C++ techniques in writing simple, expressive, and performant code for industrial applications.

Some project goals:

- Scalable to large distributed systems (hundreds of nodes on a network)
- Minimal external dependencies
- Supports Linux on 64 bit X86 and Arm CPU architectures
- Depends on the bleeding edge of development tools:
  - Latest release of compilers (Clang and GCC)
  - Latest Ubuntu LTS
  - Latest CMake
  - Latest versions of external dependencies
